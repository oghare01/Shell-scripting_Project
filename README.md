# Shell-scripting_Project

Preparation steps
A file "shellscript.sh" was first created to be able to carry out the project using the touch command on the CLI 
This was then modified using chmod command to make the file executable. The ls command was used to check the file 
The file was successdully created and the fact that the file is displayed as green indicated that the file is executable

1. DECLARING VARIABLES
   
After successfuly creating the file, the nano command was used to enter the edit mode of the file
A value "Oghare" was assigned to a variable "name" using the = operator.

The script was then run on the CLI and the result shown below shows that it was successful

2. CONTROL FLOW STATEMENTS
   
A control flow shellscript to retrieve and number and check the status of the number was written
The code was written with the following "if" and "elif" statments to see if the number entered was a +ve, -ve or 0 number

after the script was written, the code was run on the command line for the 3 possible scenarios and it worked just just fine as displayed in the image below

This was then tested on the CLi and it worked as desired. This is shown in the following image
